# Snowman-Editor

The Snowman editor is a tool which facilitates the level design by allowing the user to create a new level, try it in-game and also find a solution. The tool has multiple solvers which use the SMT approach but also allows to generate PDDL problem instances which can be used externally with the desired planner.

All the documentation can be found in the [docs](https://github.com/GerardMT/Snowman-Editor/tree/master/docs) folder.
